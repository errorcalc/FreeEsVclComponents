Name of TNinePatchImage component was a typo, I fixed it.
To correct this error in your projects need replaced in uses "Es.Vcl.NinePath" to "Es.Vcl.NinePatch", and replace in files forms (dfm) TNinePathImage to TNinePatchImage.

[RUS]

а также заменить в файлах форм (dfm) TNinePathImage на TNinePatchImage.

*** New components ***
Two new components for Delphi 10.4 Sydney: TEsVirtualImage, TEsVirtualImageControl. 
These components are similar to TEsImage and TEsImageControl but with support for TimageCollection.
TEsVirtualImage and TEsVirtualImageControl provide additional capabilities such as:
* Adjustable opacity
* Configurable pixel interpolation mode
* New stretch modes
* Ability to set a frame with style
* Ability to set background color
* Border support
* And of course - TEsVirtualImageControl doesn't flicker
*** Rewrited ES.BaseControls.pas ***
This module had a long history and support for XP and Delphi 7. 
This resulted in a bit of confusing code and a lot of IFDEFs, and the module was really hard to support.
Starting with this release, the minimum supported version of Windows is Windows 7, as well as Delphi XE2.
The end of support for XP allowed for many optimizations, as well as many rendering enhancements:
* Faster DWM buffering is now used by default.
* The code has been cleaned up and some documentation has appeared.
* Improved style support.
* And more…
*** Full support individual control styling ***
In Delphi 10.4 added support for setting different styles for different controls using the StyleName property.
Full support for this feature has been added to the library, all components support individual styling.
*** TVirtualImageList support ***
All components supporting TImageList received support for the ImageName property.
Yes - you can use TEsImage to display icons from TVirtualImageList / TVirtualImageList to TСontrolList.
*** Improved TEsPanel ***
TEsPanel now supports Caption when CaptionVisible is activated.
Disabled by default, because usually no need an Caption.
*** Other improvements ***
* Work on quality
* Cleaning up the code
* Improved support for styles
* Fixes for HiDPI
* Removing multiple IFDEFs and their associated code
* TEsImage now also supports custom frameTEsImage now also supports custom frame
* Improving Samples
*** What's next? ***
I recommend watching the Sydney Update example for new features. 
It is located in the examples folder, but is not part of the project group so that
users of previous Delphi versions have no problems. You can open it manually.

[14.09.2021]
*** What's new? ***
Added support for Delphi 11 Alexandria.
Support for design time styles for all controls.
Added a new component TEsShape.
Improvements in ES.BaseControls.pas
Improvements to the TEsPanel component.
Improved handling of focus in TEsSwitch.
Added Design Guidelines on text components like TEsPanel, TEsSwitch, etc.
Other minor improvements.
*** TEsShape ***
TEsShape is an analogue of TShape with advanced features such as:
* Anti-alisang support, which improves the appearance of the shape borders
* Opacity support
* New shapes like triangle, star, etc.
* Horizontal and vertical gradient support for brush
* You can set the corner radius for RoundRect
* You can turn the sides of the rectangle on and off (Top, Left, Bottom, Right)
* You can turn the corners of the rectangle on and off (TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight)
* There is also a Caption property for displaying text in the shape
* TEsShape uses the color from the current vcl style for standard colors
I suggest you to look at the Samples\Shapes\Shapes.dpr project to evaluate the new component!
(Samples\ShapesOld\ShapesOld.dpr for previous versions of delphi)

[04.04.2023]
*** What's new? ***
